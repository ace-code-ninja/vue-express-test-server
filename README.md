# Applicant Project

### Thanks for your interest in working with us!

In order to evaluate engineering candidates' skill sets, we provide this small sample project for candidates to complete. There are two components to implement, a backend API and a frontend web UI implementing the API.

## Requirements

Run the `generate` script to create `db/*.json` files to be used as the data for the app. These files contain businesses, campaigns, categories, & locations. Serve this data in an API and render a frontend to display businesses and business details.

## Submission Requirements

1. Create a private fork of this repo or create a private repo of your own.
2. Move or replace this README.md with instructions on how to build and run your solution.

## Technical Requirements

1. Backend should be built with Express.js
2. Frontend should be built with Vue.js

## User Stories

1. When I load the app I see a list of businesses that includes the Business Name, Category, Number of Campaigns, and Average Campaign Budget
2. When I click on a column header, the list of businesses sorts
3. When I enter text in a search box, the list of businesses filters by name
4. When I click a business's name, I am taken to a new page.
    1. At the top, I see the business's name
    1. I see the business's details
    1. I see the business's location on a map (google maps or any other map utility)
    1. I see a list of the business's campaigns that includes the Name and Budget
        1. When I click on the column header, the list of campaigns sorts
        2. When I enter text in a search box, the list of campaigns filters by name
